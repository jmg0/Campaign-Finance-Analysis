# NOTE: if you are here from MLH
I chose to submit this project because it is substantive, but my Python skills have improved dramatically since completing this, and I would love to discuss the many improvements that could be made in this code. Thank you for considering my application! As noted above, the project is stored across different repos, all of which are linked below. Data Analysis (#1) was entirely done in Python, while #2-5 were done primarily with JavaScript/HTML/CSS.
