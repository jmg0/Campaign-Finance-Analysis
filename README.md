# Campaign-Finance-Analysis

This project analyzed individual contributions to presidential campaigns in 2019-2020. I undertook this project because financial and geographic trends have powerful influences on our political system, but it is nearly impossible to draw conclusions from campaign contribution data without a technical background. My aim was to make this information more accessible and to make its analysis more easily reproducible in the future.

The project was completed across four component phases, shown below and linked to their corresponding repositores. Item five links to the deployed website.
